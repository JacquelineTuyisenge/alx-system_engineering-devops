## Postmortem

## Issue Summary
Duration: 1 hour (August 14th, 2023, 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM ACT)
Impact: The web application experienced a complete outage, rendering it inaccessible for all users.
Root Cause: The servers were overwhelmed by an unexpected surge in traffic, causing them to crash.

## Timeline
10:00 AM: Users reported that they were unable to access the web application, which prompted the engineering team to investigate the issue.
10:02 AM: The team received an alert from the monitoring system indicating that the web application was down.
10:05 AM: The team began diagnosing the problem by analyzing the server logs and running diagnostic tests.
10:15 AM: The team initially suspected that the issue was caused by a bug or error in the application code.
10:30 AM: As the problem persisted, the team realized that the servers were unable to handle the sudden increase in traffic.
10:45 AM: The issue was escalated to senior management as it required additional resources and attention.
11:00 AM: The incident was resolved by increasing server capacity and optimizing the application code.

## Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the issue was an unexpected surge in traffic that overwhelmed the servers, resulting in a complete outage for all users. To address the problem, the engineering team increased server capacity to handle additional traffic and optimized the application code to improve its performance and reduce resource usage.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, the following corrective and preventative measures will be implemented:

Increase server capacity to handle unexpected traffic surges by implementing automatic scaling to adjust capacity based on traffic.
Optimize application code to improve performance and resource utilization.
Improve monitoring to detect issues more quickly and accurately.
Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to ensure that the web application can be quickly restored in the event of an outage.

Overall, the incident highlights the importance of having robust infrastructure and effective monitoring in place to ensure the continuous availability and performance of critical web applications. The corrective and preventative measures outlined will help prevent future incidents and ensure that users have uninterrupted access to the web application.
